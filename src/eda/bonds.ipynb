    "# What are Bonds? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonds are essentially IOUs issued by governments, companies, or other entities to borrow money.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics:\n",
    "- **Face Value/Par Value**: The amount the bond will be worth at maturity (usually $1,000 or ₹1,000)\n",
    "- **Coupon Rate**: The interest rate the bond pays annually (as a % of face value)\n",
    "- **Maturity Date**: When the bond expires and you get your principal back\n",
    "- **Yield**: The actual return you earn (can differ from coupon rate due to price changes)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Bonds:\n",
    "1. **Government Bonds**: Issued by governments (safest, lowest yields)\n",
    "   - US: Treasury bonds\n",
    "   - Canada: Government of Canada bonds\n",
    "   - India: Government Securities (G-Secs)\n",
    "   - Europe: Sovereign bonds\n",
    "   - China: Government bonds\n",
    "   - Japan: JGBs (Japanese Government Bonds)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Corporate Bonds**: Issued by companies (higher yields, higher risk)\n",
    "3. **Municipal Bonds**: Issued by local governments\n",
    "4. **Agency Bonds**: Issued by government agencies\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Do Entities Issue Bonds?\n",
    "- Governments: Finance deficits, infrastructure\n",
    "- Companies: Fund operations, expansion, debt refinancing\n",
    "- Lower cost than equity financing (no ownership dilution)"

    "# Topic 1: Getting Your First US Treasury Yield Data 📊\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Get real US Treasury yield data and understand what it means.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this topic first?** Treasury yields are the foundation of all bond markets. The 10-year US Treasury yield is called the \"global risk-free rate\" - it influences borrowing costs worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Install the FRED API library\n",
    "Run this command in your terminal:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install fredapi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Get a free FRED API key\n",
    "1. Go to: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html\n",
    "2. Sign up for a free account\n",
    "3. Copy your API key (it looks like: abc123def456...)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Run the code below\n",
    "Replace `'your_api_key_here'` with your actual API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Understand the output\n",
    "- The number you see is the current 10-year Treasury yield (as a percentage)\n",
    "- Example: If it shows 4.25, that means 4.25%\n",
    "- This is the interest rate the US government pays on 10-year bonds\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Questions to ask yourself:\n",
    "- Is this yield higher or lower than you expected?\n",
    "- How does this compare to current bank interest rates?\n",
    "- What do you think this says about the economy?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next**: Once you get this working, we'll look at how this yield changes over time and what moves it."
